= Roadmap =

This document is always subject to change, but basically covers which version of Classilla will come out when. In keeping with the OS 9-specific motif, initial versions will be numbered according to official Apple versions of OS 9 (while they last).

==Classilla 9.0==

This was the first release of Classilla with the updated "Clecko" layout engine. It is roughly the equivalent of Mozilla 1.6, but this is not exact (it lacks some 1.6 features, but also adds features from as late as 1.8). This version had layout and multiple security improvements, along with changes for rebranding and Mac-specific bug fixes.

This version was intentionally unfinished -- since WaMCom is no longer updated, this is the only version of Mozilla for the classic Mac that is even still theoretically maintained, so its release was accelerated to ensure continuity. For that reason, it was released in 'pre-alpha' form on June 30th, 2009.

==Classilla 9.0.4==

This was the second release of Classilla. It added additional security and network improvements from Bugzilla, and updates to !JavaScript and DOM. Additional layout improvements were also present in this release, along with an experimental fixup rendering mode for sites that cannot be rendered with the standard layout engine, and various other MacOS-specific stability and functionality issues were also repaired. This was the final version to support Chatzilla.

Classilla 9.0.4 was released on October 28th, 2009.

==Classilla 9.1==

This was the third release of Classilla. This version restored the layout overflow branch (replacing the 9.0.4 experimental renderer), allowing more advanced rendering and further improvements with site compatibility, roughly somewhere between Mozilla 1.7 and 1.8, though again this is not exact (it lacks some core features of 1.7, but adds code from as late as 1.9). It also repaired the most important regressions caused by 9.0.4.

Classilla 9.1 was released on February 26th, 2010.

==Classilla 9.2==

This will be the fourth release of Classilla. This version will completely rewrite !JavaScript, replacing it with as recent a version from Mozilla sources as possible. In addition, there will be more updates to DOM and any layout changes necessary to facilitate or stabilize the improvements to !JavaScript. The most important regressions caused by 9.1 will also be repaired, and theming will be restored for this release. Updates to NSS and libnecko will also be considered for this release.

Classilla 9.2 has an expected release date of Q3 2010.

==Classilla 9.2.1==

This will be the fifth release of Classilla. This version will repair regressions caused by 9.2, and will also introduce Script-B-Gone, a Classilla-specific front-end to !NoScript. Updates to NSS and libnecko will also be considered for this release, along with relevant security content, and strings will be stabilized with 9.2.1 to allow language packs to be officially supported in 9.2.2.

There is currently no ETA for 9.2.1.

==Classilla 9.2.2==

This will be the sixth release of Classilla. This will be a bugfix rollup only, repairing any regressions caused by 9.2.1 and any new bugs introduced by Script-B-Gone. The only new feature will be the official introduction of language packs into the core browser.

There is currently no ETA for 9.2.2, although it is expected to be shortly after the release of 9.2.1 as this release is intentionally narrow in scope.

==Classilla 9.3==

This will be the seventh release of Classilla and the first version with a "unique" version number, since the OS 9 version numbering motif will have been exhausted. Starting with 9.3, Classilla will be numbered according to a conventional major-minor-patch scheme. This release will specifically focus on upgrades to layout, although the scope of this update is yet to be determined. More information will be available after the release of 9.2.x.

There is currently no ETA for 9.3.
