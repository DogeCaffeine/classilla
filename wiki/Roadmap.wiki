= Roadmap =

This document is always subject to change, but basically covers which version of Classilla will come out when. In keeping with the OS 9-specific motif, initial versions will be numbered according to official Apple versions of OS 9 (while they last).

==Classilla 9.0==

This was the first release of Classilla with the updated "Clecko" layout engine. It is roughly the equivalent of Mozilla 1.6, but this is not exact (it lacks some 1.6 features, but also adds features from as late as 1.8). This version had layout and multiple security improvements, along with changes for rebranding and Mac-specific bug fixes.

This version was intentionally unfinished -- since WaMCom is no longer updated, this is the only version of Mozilla for the classic Mac that is even still theoretically maintained, so its release was accelerated to ensure continuity. For that reason, it was released in 'pre-alpha' form on June 30th, 2009.

==Classilla 9.0.4==

This was the second release of Classilla. It has additional security and network improvements from Bugzilla, and updates to !JavaScript and DOM. Additional layout improvements are also present in this release, along with an experimental fixup rendering mode for sites that cannot be rendered with the standard layout engine, and various other MacOS-specific stability and functionality issues have also been repaired. This improves Classilla's current bug list, although more work remains planned for future versions.

Classilla 9.0.4 was released on October 28th, 2009.

==Classilla 9.0.5 through 9.0.9==

These are placeholder versions for a planned update of the !JavaScript interpreter engine. Further security improvements will also be selected and applied from Bugzilla.
As this is a low-level change and may induce new bugs, this is being done on "beta" versions for testing, with 9.0.4 remaining on !JavaScript 1.5 as the stable version.

*Milestone 9.0.5*: Remove Chatzilla; update !JavaScript to Mozilla 1.8.1.x (or 1.9.1.x if possible). All security patches for core JS engine should be applied.

*Milestone 9.0.6*: Complete transformation of !NoScript into Script-B-Gone, with new interface (including "one click enable for all scripts on current URL"). Continue security update.

*Milestone 9.0.7*: Beta prior to 9.1. There should be no outstanding security issues by this milestone.

*Milestone 9.0.8*: Remaining outstanding layout blockers and regressions, if any. Internationalization packs may also be supported starting with this release.

*Milestone 9.0.9*: If needed.

==Classilla 9.1==

First official release version with updated !JavaScript internals. *_This version will achieve the core goal of a fully secure classic Mac OS browser._* Other changes may be landed for this version. There is no ETA at this time.

==Classilla 9.1.1 through 9.1.9==

Under consideration. Fixed SVG support is being reviewed as a possible feature.

==Classilla 9.2==

Future.
