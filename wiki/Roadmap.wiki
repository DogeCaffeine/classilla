= Roadmap =

This document is always subject to change, but basically covers which version of Classilla will come out when. In keeping with the OS 9-specific motif, initial versions will be numbered according to official Apple versions of OS 9 (while they last).

==Classilla 9.0==

This was the first release of Classilla with the updated "Clecko" layout engine. It is roughly the equivalent of Mozilla 1.6, but this is not exact (it lacks some 1.6 features, but also adds features from as late as 1.8). This version had layout and multiple security improvements, along with changes for rebranding and Mac-specific bug fixes.

This version was intentionally unfinished -- since WaMCoM is no more, this is the only version of Mozilla for the classic Mac that even exists in theoretical form, so its release was accelerated to ensure continuity. For that reason, it was released in 'pre-alpha' form on June 30th, 2009.

==Classilla 9.0.4==

This will be the second release of Classilla. It will continue to add security and network improvements from Bugzilla, and will have updates to !JavaScript DOM. Layout improvements will be intentionally restricted to showstoppers and significant flaws only, although some large changes will still be landed. Various other MacOS-specific stability and functionality issues will also be targetted for this release.

Please note that due to the large lag in Mozilla on OS 9, this version will still have known bugs (just less, and much fewer fatal ones).

Classilla 9.0.4 has an expected release date of October-November 2009.

==Classilla 9.0.5 through 9.0.9==

These are placeholder versions for a planned update of the !JavaScript interpreter engine. Further security improvements will also be selected and applied from Bugzilla.
As this is a low-level change and may induce new bugs, this is being done on "beta" versions for testing, with 9.0.4 remaining on !JavaScript 1.5 as the stable version.

==Classilla 9.1==

First official release version with updated !JavaScript internals. Other changes may be landed for this version. There is no ETA at this time.

==Classilla 9.1.1 through 9.1.9==

These are placeholder versions for a planned update of the layout engine with an eye towards Acid2 compliance. Debug building will be specifically fixed by this version to facilitate layout study. This may require the large patch in Bugzilla 300030 along with other specific large scale changes, hence the protracted testing period. These versions will also be "beta" with 9.1 remaining on the old layout system as the stable version.

==Classilla 9.2==

First official release with updated layout. Other changes may be landed for this version, including any new changes to !JavaScript if possible. There is no ETA at this time.

==Classilla 9.2.1, 9.2.2, ... ?==
Future versions are currently under consideration.
